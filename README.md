### Who Am I?

I'm a creative technologist currently doing an intensive web development course at Northcoders. I'm doing this course because I've been obsessed with making website and web applications since early 2025, although my experience with that started way earlier.

### Why Am I djSQL?

I'm djSQL because when I play video games I love sweeping through Side Quests. It is also because I love database. And I'm a DJ sometimes when I'm not coding.

### Stuff I have done in the past

- Created UI/UX design and did a bit front-end for an interactive online space specialised for gigs and performances during Covid (2021)

- Produced an event series for cross-continental performance together with dances and musicians from 2 different cities (between New York and London) (2022-2024), managing live coordination between performers and the technical pipeline in the 3 successfully delivered events

- This list is a Work in Progress...
