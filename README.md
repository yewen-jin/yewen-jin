# Hi there, I'm Yewen Jin 👋

## Creative Technologist & Multidisciplinary Artist

I'm a developer and artist working at the intersection of **technology, performance, and creative coding**. My practice explores real-time, data-driven collaboration in sound, visuals, and movement, often through custom-built software tools and networked systems.

### 🚀 What I Do

- **Creative Coding**: Building interactive audiovisual experiences using JavaScript and WebGL
- **Livecoding**: Real-time performance and visual synthesis in the browser
- **Web Audio Synthesis**: Generative and experimental sound experiences for the web
- **Networked Collaboration**: Low-latency remote performance systems and interactive installations

### 💻 Technical Focus

I work primarily with web technologies to create innovative real-time applications:

- **Languages**: JavaScript, HTML/CSS, WebGL
- **Creative Platforms**: Hydra (video synthesis), Flocking (audio synthesis)
- **Areas**: Browser-based livecoding, networked visuals, generative art, real-time collaboration

### 🎨 Key Projects & Contributions

- **[Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/)**: Livecoding networked visuals in the browser - fork and contributions to the video synth platform
- **[Flocking](https://flockingjs.org/)**: Creative audio synthesis framework for the web
- **Networked Performance Tools**: Custom-built systems for remote, collaborative audiovisual performances
- **Interactive Installations**: Projects exploring presence, embodiment, and mediated realities in digital spaces

### 🌟 Research & Practice

My work is situated in the **post-digital era**, focusing on:

- Systems of stimuli and remote collaboration
- The intersection between the self, the body, and technology
- Live performances and interactive media art
- Epistemology of creative computation
