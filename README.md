### Who is djSQL?

When djSQL plays video games she sweeps through side quests, hence the name side quest legend.

djSQL is a creative technologist currently doing an intensive web development course at Northcoders. She's doing this course because she has been obsessed with making websites and web applications for the past year and maybe even longer ago.



### Stuff she's done in the past

- Created UI/UX design and did a bit front-end for an interactive online space specialised for gigs and performances in 2021

- Produced an event series for cross-continental performance together with dances and musicians from 2 different cities (between New York and London) (2022-2024), managing live coordination between performers and the technical pipeline in the 3 successfully delivered events
